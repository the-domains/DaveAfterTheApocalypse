# Dave (just before the apocalypse)

In the grand scheme of things, it wasn't a long way to the mailbox -- When you're 300 pounds, even getting out of the chair is a long way.

The mailbox was at the end of the long driveway. Dave noticed the asphalt was crumbling. It was not so bad that Dave would spend the money, much less the mental energy, to get it recovered. A slurry coat, the driveway salesmen had called it. Why Dave remembered that little detail, but not a little detail like paying the gas bill, was odd. At least to Dave. It was all about the mental energy. That and the room in his brain for interesting things. A slurry wasn't interesting, so why remember it?

This mental space used to worry Dave, but no longer. It still bothered him, but that was a far cry from worry. There had ben enough times when a word like slurry would appear like out of nowhere in his writing, and that would please him. Unfortunately it always pleased Dave of the future, not Dave of now. He was lucky to have downgraded his worry to bother. That would really please his therapist, only he didn't have one.
